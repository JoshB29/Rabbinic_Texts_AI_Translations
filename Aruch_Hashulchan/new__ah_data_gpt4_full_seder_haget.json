                    "In the days of the sages of the Talmud, it was customary to appoint a knowledgeable scholar for the process of divorce documents (gittin). It is also found in the words of the early authorities that they would only give a get (divorce document) in front of the great scholars of the generation. Therefore, one should only be involved in the giving of a get if they are expert in it. Anyone who is not proficient in the laws of gittin and kiddushin (marriage) should not involve themselves with them. Consequently, the custom spread that the rabbi and scholar of the town would arrange the entire get from beginning to end, and without him, the scribe would not lift his hand to write, the witnesses would not lift their hands to sign, and the messenger would not lift his foot to go on the mission of delivering the get (Yam Shel Shlomo, Gittin, Chapter 1, Section 7). A get arranged by laypeople should be invalidated because it is almost certain that it was not done according to the law. It is forbidden to arrange a get using printed divorce manuals in the German language, as this causes much confusion, and the husband does not understand what is essential and what is secondary. It is forbidden for the arranger to use such a manual. Instead, they should arrange it according to the words of our Rabbis, the authors of the Shulchan Aruch, and should know the primary laws thoroughly from the source. If not, they should not involve themselves in this matter, as it is likely to lead to a serious error, God forbid.",
                    "Section 2:\nAnd our teacher, the Rema, wrote in Yoreh De'ah, Siman 242, Section 14: \"There are those who say that someone who is not ordained to be a 'Moreinu' and gives gittin (divorce documents) and chalitzot (levirate annulments), his actions are invalid. One must be concerned about gittin and chalitzot that he gave unless it is well known to everyone that he is an expert for the public but, due to humility and lowliness, does not seek greatness. There are those who disagree and are lenient, and in a situation of potential agunah (a woman unable to remarry), one should be lenient if he has already given gittin and chalitzot.\" End of quote.",
                    "Some are careful not to arrange a get (divorce document) on Friday or on the eve of a holiday (as noted in Sefer Mitzvot Gedolot by Rabbi Yosef from Krakow). However, in a pressing situation, there is no need to be concerned about this (as noted in Geonim Mitzvot). The custom follows this guidance, and there are two reasons for it. The first reason is that we are concerned that due to the busyness of Friday or the eve of a holiday, they may not be meticulous in the arrangements (as noted in Terumat HaDeshen, section 247), but this is merely an extra precaution (as noted there). The second reason is that it resembles the law that one does not judge on Friday or on the eve of a holiday, as stated in Choshen Mishpat, section 5. Although a get is not a judgment, since we are stringent about giving a get at night and requiring a court initially because it resembles a judgment, the same applies to Friday and the eve of a holiday. However, in truth, these are also stringencies without a source, and in a pressing situation, we do not consider them. Additionally, the prohibition of judging on Friday or the eve of a holiday is not an actual prohibition; it is just that it is not feasible to summon for judgment on that day, as stated in Choshen Mishpat there. Even though it is explained there that it is also proper that judges should not judge even with the consent of the litigants because they need to deliberate carefully, and on Friday and the eve of a holiday they are preoccupied (as noted in Sema, there, section 3), nevertheless, this is the first reason, and from Terumat HaDeshen there it is understood explicitly that from a legal perspective, only chalitzah (levirate release) and not gittin (divorces) should be prohibited on Friday or the eve of a holiday. Therefore, only the first reason remains, and this is merely an extra precaution. Therefore, if there is even a slight concern, they should arrange the get on Friday or the eve of a holiday, and certainly the delivery of the get from the messenger to the woman, which does not involve much effort, is certainly permitted on Friday or the eve of a holiday (and Pischei Teshuva, section 2, brings from Terumat HaDeshen that this too is not correct, and he erred in this, for it is not found at all in Terumat HaDeshen).",
                    "Section 4: Similarly, regarding the night, our master the Beit Yosef wrote in section 88 as follows: \"There are those who say that the giving of the get (divorce document) must be during the day and not at night. And similarly, if the congregation has already prayed the evening prayer, even though it is still day, a get should not be given then because it is already considered night, unless in a pressing circumstance, in which case even at night it may be written and given.\" And similarly, regarding the requirement of three [individuals] for the arrangement of the get: although certainly, fundamentally according to the law, there is no basis for this, and our sages explicitly stated (Bava Batra 174b): \"Is it that everyone who divorces does so in a court?\" [implying it is not necessary], and only for chalitza and refusal (mi'un) are three required, as it is taught at the beginning of Sanhedrin (and this is the intention of Rashi there, as the Maharam Schick wrote, and not as the Nodah Biyhudah, and pay attention). And if one thought that a get also requires a court, why was this not taught along with them? And it is also implied at the beginning of Gittin that only one sage was appointed over bills of divorce. Nevertheless, since the practice has become to do it publicly, it is proper from the outset to be meticulous about this if possible. And Yonatan translated \"and he shall write her a document of severance\" as \"and he shall write her a document of separation before the court.\" And there is one who says that the essence of the get does not require a court, but the questions that the rabbi asks the scribe and the witnesses constitute the acceptance of testimony and thus require three (Chatam Sofer). But this does not seem correct to me, for what connection does this have to the acceptance of testimony? He is merely clarifying if they acted properly, and this is like any other questions of civil matters. And what is the relevance of this to divorces? (Also, what he wrote, that because the get remains with the court and they give her a release, and therefore it must be a court proceeding, I am astonished, for certainly the essence of the get requires that the court sign it, and this has no relevance to the arrangement of the get).",
                    "<b>5</b> He should appoint a scribe and two valid witnesses who are not relatives to each other nor to the husband or the wife. The degree of kinship that disqualifies witnesses is up to the second degree in the third generation according to the law, as stated in Choshen Mishpat, Siman 33. However, ideally, one should be meticulous and select witnesses who have no kinship even in the fourth degree (Shulchan Aruch and Levush). It implies that in the fifth degree of kinship, there is no concern even initially, as the generation has already separated significantly. Proof of this is that even a father is qualified to testify about his fifth-generation descendant according to all opinions, as stated there. All the more so, minor kinships are permissible. Even in the fourth to fifth degree, there is no need to be precise. Nevertheless, the custom is to take witnesses who are completely distant, both from each other and from the man and the woman. Furthermore, they should not be in-laws to each other or to the man and woman, even though an in-law is valid as a witness, as stated there.",
                    "One must also be cautious regarding other types of disqualifications in witnesses, and also if there is a rumor that they are suspected of sexual immorality, even though there is no clear evidence for this. Thus, our Sages said (Sanhedrin 26b) that one who is suspected of sexual immorality is invalid for testimony regarding a woman. Although there are varying opinions about this concerning marriage, as mentioned earlier in Siman 42, regarding a divorce document (get), he is invalid according to all opinions because he has a vested interest in her being single and available to him. Additionally, witnesses should not be gamblers, even if it is not their primary occupation, because as we explained in Choshen Mishpat Siman 34, gambling is considered rabbinic theft. Although many authorities do not consider it theft, Maimonides does not agree, and the general public perceives it as entirely permissible, which is questionable.",
                    "<b>7</b> Additionally, they wrote that one should not take [as a witness] someone who has a physical defect, but there is no reason for this, as a person with a physical defect is not disqualified from testimony. After all, even in capital cases, such a person is qualified. What stringency is there in this? They wrote the reason that logic dictates that a person with a physical defect would not permit a married woman to [remarry] the world (Darkei Moshe and Levush), but this reasoning is obscure; what logic is there in this? Only a blind person in both eyes is disqualified from testimony, because for testimony we require vision. All the more so in the case of a get (divorce document), where it is necessary to read the get and see the transfer from his hand to hers and recognize the man and the woman, which is a disqualification by Torah law. But for other physical defects or a person blind in one eye, what disqualification is there in this? And it seems to me that people are not careful about this.",
                    "The custom is that the rabbi tells the witnesses to contemplate repentance in their hearts for sins they have committed, even if they are presumed to be completely righteous, for perhaps they have sinned in secret. This practice is an ordinance of Rabbeinu Tam, of blessed memory. Nevertheless, one should not rely on this if it is known that someone is committing a sin, even if their disqualification is not according to strict law, for the law regarding a penitent is explained in Choshen Mishpat, Siman 34, that speech alone is not sufficient, but rather a complete act that demonstrates repentance for the specific sin committed, as it says there. All the more so, one should not rely on their superficial statement that they have repented, which is like a mockery in their hearts, since this is merely a formal expression. The benefit is only that perhaps some sin will be found for which they are not completely disqualified according to strict law, and only because the matter is disgraceful do we rely on this, since otherwise, by strict law, they are fit. Know that even though we hold that a person is not disqualified by their own admission—since a person does not make themselves wicked—nevertheless, in the case of a get (divorce document), God forbid to take such a person as a witness, and we do not rely on their being commanded to repent. However, a completely penitent person is certainly fit to be a witness, for in the place where penitents stand, the fully righteous cannot stand, as our Sages have stated.",
                    "Section 9: They are also meticulous that the witnesses should not be related to the scribe or the rabbi who arranges the get (divorce document), though this is only a stringency, and in a pressing situation, we do not adhere to it. Refer to what is written in section 130. Additionally, they are careful that the scribe should be a reputable person, since we rely on him to write it for its proper purpose, and also that he should not be related to either the husband or the wife. These too are merely stringencies, and in a pressing situation, we do not adhere to them. Similarly, they are meticulous that the rabbi arranging the get should not be related to either the husband or the wife, which is appropriate, for there are those who say that a court is needed for the giving of the get. Even though we do not hold this view, nevertheless, we are concerned for it, and it is obvious that a relative is invalid to judge. If the relative of the rabbi needs to divorce, the rabbi should appoint another in his place and oversee him, guiding and instructing him on what to do.",
                    "The witnesses must understand the essence of the get (bill of divorce) and read it, and they must know how to sign. If they know how to sign but do not know how to read, and there are no other qualified individuals, or there are other qualified individuals who know how to read but not how to sign, those who know how to sign are taught to read. If it is not possible to teach them to read by themselves, two people read the get in front of them and explain the matter until they themselves understand the language of the get, even if they do not understand the duplicated phrases. Additionally, the husband must also understand the essence of the get. If the husband and the witnesses do not understand the matter of \"for her sake\" and \"for his sake\" and \"for the sake of divorce,\" they should be taught until they understand it themselves (as stated in section 63 from the Rema of Krakow). This is a fundamental principle upon which the validity of the get depends. It has already been explained in section 130 that when they do not know how to sign, a blank paper is torn in the form of the letters, and they sign there. This is only done in extreme necessity, and they should not sign in any script other than Ashurit script, even though it is valid in a case of binding as mentioned in sections 126 and 130.",

They should be examined by two knowledgeable adults, and the hairs must be specifically in the pubic area. Similarly, the scribe must also meet this criterion, as it is a complete law that the scribe is an agent of the husband, and a minor cannot be an agent. The two hairs must have follicles and must have grown after reaching adulthood, not from before. If there are signs of a eunuch, they are considered minors until most of their years have passed, which is thirty-six years. The laws are explained in Siman 155 and 172.",

                    "<b>13</b> Preferably, we tell the husband to pay the fee of the scribe, since it is his responsibility to write the get (divorce document). However, if he refuses, the wife can pay, as the Rabbis transferred her money to him for the sake of the welfare of agunot (women bound in marriage) (Gittin 20a). But the fee for the witnesses and certainly the fee for the rabbi can be paid by the wife even if the husband was not told to pay (ibid.) because it is not his obligation. According to the law, anyone is acceptable to write a get, except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, a minor, a Samaritan, or someone who has become an apostate or publicly desecrates Shabbat, even according to rabbinic law he is completely disqualified. Additionally, one must take care that the scribe does not sign as a witness, because according to several early authorities, a scribe who signs as both a scribe and a witness is disqualified, as mentioned in Siman 130, see there.",
                    "**14** Our rabbis, the authors of the Shulchan Aruch, state that if the scribe or the sage arranging the get (divorce document) take a significantly larger fee than what would compensate for their time, some say that the witnesses must not be related to them, as they would be considered to have a vested interest in the testimony due to their relatives' fee. Although it is already written that the witnesses should not be relatives, that was merely a customary practice, but here there is a slight concern according to the law. It is further written: \"And Rabbi Ovadia in the fourth chapter of Bechorot criticized the rabbis who arrange the get for taking much more than the compensation for their time. However, his opinion was not adopted, and his reasoning is baseless, for he compares this to those who take a fee to judge, whose judgments are invalid. This is not a valid comparison, as arranging the get is not a judgment but merely a form of teaching.\" Even according to the opinion that disqualifies [a get arranged] at night and the opinion that requires a beit din (Jewish court), this only applies at the time of delivery and the examination and investigation of the witnesses and the scribe. But all the effort in arranging and the questions asked to the husband, whether he gives willingly and whether he did not declare a preemptive protest, certainly do not require a beit din. This is merely a form of teaching. And even regarding the witnesses, we have clarified in Siman 130 that although according to Torah law it is forbidden to take a fee for delivering testimony, they may nevertheless take as much as they wish, as they are not taking a fee for the testimony itself but for the effort of going, standing, signing, and witnessing the delivery, which they are not obligated to do. The obligation of the witness is only when he sees the testimony that he should go and testify, not to go and witness the testimony. See there.",
                    "Another thing they wrote is that the husband should align himself with the rabbi, the scribe, and the witnesses before they begin writing. The reason is that if they do not align with him initially, there is concern that when he later hears they want a lot of payment, he will regret it and change his mind about giving the get (divorce document), thereby nullifying the scribe’s and witnesses’ agency. Later, when they settle with him, by law they would need to renew the agency as initially, but they will not do so and will rely on his original words, which have already been nullified (Levush). Even if she is the one paying for the get and according to her there is no concern, or even if they do not speak to the husband until after the get is given, and there is no concern of nullification, nevertheless, there is still a concern that upon hearing this, he will become angry with them and cast aspersions on the get. It is known that with a get, one must avoid any potential for casting aspersions as much as possible. Therefore, after the fact, we do not worry about it, and even if he is the one paying for the get, since we have not heard any nullification from him. However, if witnesses indeed heard from him any nullification regarding the get, it is obvious that it must be redone, and the initial matters are invalidated.",

It is also good to mix in what adheres to the utensils from the smoke when cooking them, called rus, and they are well-cooked (Rema of Kraków). The common custom is to write with a quill from a bird's feather, and it is forbidden to write with an iron pen. Writing is done on smooth paper that does not have holes and gaps, as explained in Siman 125, see there.",
                    "The witnesses and also the scribe need to recognize that this is a particular person (Ploni) and that this is his wife (Plonit). Why does the scribe also need to recognize them? Because he needs to hear from the husband and write it for his name and her name, and necessarily, he needs to know that he is the husband and she is the wife. We explained this in Siman 120, see there. However, this recognition does not need to be based on witnesses and those who are valid to testify, but even based on a woman or relatives, because it is a matter that is bound to be revealed and people do not lie about it. Nevertheless, it seems that one should not rely on minors because they lack understanding. In a situation of danger where the get (bill of divorce) is urgent and there is no time to investigate and inquire, they write it even if they do not recognize them. It seems to me that nevertheless, they should later investigate and inquire about this, and they should not allow her to remarry until it is known that she was indeed the wife of the man who divorced her. Similarly, they should not give her a release document according to our custom until it is known. This is also what I have practiced.",
                    "\n18. If there is another man in the city with the same name, including the same patronymic (father's name), and his wife's name is also the same, including the same patronymic, one should not issue a divorce (get) except in the presence of the other man, as stated in Siman 136. Even according to our established practice following Rabbi Eliezer, who holds that the condition (to recognize the identity of parties) is what effectuates the divorce, and the condition is known that this is indeed his wife, we are still concerned that they might not be meticulous enough and might give the get to the other man's wife. And why would they not be meticulous? Because they know that this woman's name is such-and-such, just like his wife's name, and it wouldn't occur to them that she might be the other man's wife, as stated there in paragraphs 15 and 16. We explained there in paragraph 17 in the name of the Rashba, of blessed memory, that even if they write a distinguishing mark to differentiate between them, such as Cohen or Levi, or something similar, one still needs to issue the get in the presence of the other man, lest the witnesses not be meticulous about the distinguishing mark. Nonetheless, it is still necessary to write the distinguishing mark, as stated there in paragraph 18, because, according to Rabbi Meir, it needs to be explicitly clear from within the document itself, and initially we should ensure the get satisfies all opinions. And our teacher, the Rema, was stringent there even when their wives' names were not the same, that they should issue the divorce in each other’s presence, which is merely an extra stringency. We explained there in paragraph 20 that in such cases, a distinguishing mark alone is certainly sufficient, and it does not need to be done in each other's presence. Some have written that in this case, the common practice does not follow his opinion, as it is an excessive stringency without a proper reason (according to the Pri Tzadik in the name of Yeshuat Yaakov).",
                    "If the one who is divorcing is a person on their deathbed, one must be meticulous that he is of sound mind at the time of writing and at the time of giving [the get, the divorce document]. And certainly at the time he commanded the writing. But if he became mentally incapacitated between the writing and the giving, it is implied from [Rav Yosef Karo's] words that we are not concerned, since he was of sound mind at the time of the giving. However, some say that he must be of sound mind from the time he commands the writing until the completion of the giving, as is stated in Siman 121, which is the opinion of the Tosafists. But we have explained there in paragraph 18 that even the opinion of the Tosafists is not so, and it is a great stringency and impossible to maintain. The intention of the Tosafists is when he does not give the get himself but through an agent, in which case there is reason to say that if he becomes mentally incapacitated in the interim, the agency is nullified. But when he gives the get himself, there is no concern at all about his incapacitation in the interim. And we have explained the matter there with reasoning, with the help of Heaven, and the manner of his examination is explained there.",
                    "<b>20</b> If one wishes to divorce on condition, he should not mention any condition before the delivery of the get (bill of divorce). Rather, he should instruct the scribe to write the get and the witnesses to sign it, without mentioning any condition until the moment of delivering the get into her hand. The reason for this has been explained in Siman 147, where it is clarified that we distance ourselves from a conditional get in all matters because the laws of conditions in a get are many and profound, and it is easy to err. However, in a case of necessity and when there is no alternative, he may give her a conditional get. The sage must be well-versed in the laws of conditions as explained in Siman 38 and from Siman 143 to Siman 147. Otherwise, there is a risk, Heaven forbid, of a great error, as is evident. There are many opinions regarding the methods of making a condition, and therefore it is appropriate to avoid imposing a condition in a get as much as possible. For this reason, the decree of Rabbeinu Yitzchak of Paris was established even for a get of a critically ill person, not to divorce on condition, as stated in Siman 148. Only in the case of a Kohen (priest) is it necessary to divorce on condition so that she may be permitted to him when he recovers from his illness, as stated there.",
                    "<b>21</b> Additionally, it is written in section 10 that the husband himself should not write the get (bill of divorce) where possible, as stated. We have already been puzzled by this in section 123, paragraph 12, and we struggled to provide some reasoning for this, as mentioned there. It is obvious that in a place where there is no one else to write, the husband will write it himself and will declare before writing, \"I am writing this get for my wife [name], the daughter of [name], and for the purpose of divorce.\" It is further written that the husband should not instruct the scribe to write or not to write certain things, as stated. Certainly, one must be cautious about this, as he might command the scribe to write something not included in all gittin (bills of divorce) or command him not to write something that is included in all gittin. If the scribe does not follow his instructions, it will result in a deviation from his agency, and the get will be invalid. Therefore, the husband should simply instruct the scribe, \"Write a get,\" etc., and the scribe will write as required.",
                    "<b>22</b> It is a clear matter that the paper, ink, and quill must belong to the husband, as it is his responsibility to write it. Therefore, it has been explained that the scribe transfers these items to the husband, as it is assumed that the scribe has all these materials ready. The scribe will say in the presence of witnesses, \"I am giving you as a complete gift the paper, the ink with the container in which the ink is, the quill, and all the writing tools.\" The husband then receives them from him and lifts them three handbreadths, thereby acquiring them according to all opinions. Afterwards, he gives them to the scribe and commands him to write, as will be explained. What we have written, that the scribe should say to him in the presence of witnesses, is not fundamentally required by law, as in monetary matters witnesses were created only to prevent falsehoods (Kiddushin 65b). However, to avoid any doubts or objections from the husband who might later claim that he did not give them to him, it is good to hand them over in the presence of witnesses. Further on, it will be explained that the husband needs to annul any prior declarations.",
                    "Rabbi Moshe Isserles (the Rema) wrote in paragraph 13: \"There are those who say that before the scribe gives the husband these items, the husband should nullify any pre-existing announcements, and this is investigated as will be explained, and afterward he receives these items from the scribe.\" This is indeed the custom, end of quote. However, I do not know why he specifically receives them afterward and not before. What is cited in the Tur in the name of the Rosh is the opposite. The Tur states: \"The scribe should give the parchment and the ink to the husband as a gift, etc., and before giving the get (divorce document), the husband should declare that he nullifies all pre-existing announcements, etc.\" It is possible that the reason is to ensure there is no interruption between the scribe handing the items to him and the writing of the get. Therefore, the husband first nullifies the announcements and then the scribe hands him all the items. Immediately, the husband hands everything back to the scribe and instructs him to write and the witnesses to sign, and the scribe proceeds to write as is our custom. Additionally, the main point is that even though the earlier authorities wrote that the nullification of announcements is before the giving (of the get), the custom is to nullify also before the writing, as stated in Siman 134, paragraph 3. The reason is explained there in paragraph 19. Since the nullification is also done before the writing, it is better to nullify before any act of writing, which means before the scribe hands over the items, so there will be no interruption afterward. The precise language of the Tur indicates that the nullification was before the writing, even though it says before the giving.",
                    "Section 24: The Tur writes in the name of the Rosh regarding the process of the get (divorce document) that it is preferable for the husband to be present with the scribe and the witnesses until the get is written, signed, and given, so that he does not leave and issue a protest or invalidate the get. However, if he leaves, the get is not invalidated because of this as long as we have not heard that he invalidated it. These are the words of the Tur. Similarly, the Rambam writes in Chapter 6, Halacha 20, and these are his words: \"They should not let him go until the get reaches her hand so that he does not leave and invalidate it.\" And I am puzzled because our masters, the authors of the Shulchan Aruch, in their arrangement also wrote this in Section 23. However, in Section 76, they wrote that if the husband leaves between the writing and the giving, they should make him swear that he did not invalidate it, etc. See there. According to their view, this is not necessary.",
                    "<b>25</b> Behold, the Rambam and the Tur only mentioned the nullification of a preemptive declaration of voiding (moda'ah) before the writing of the get (bill of divorce), but not before the giving of the get. This is explicitly stated in the Rambam, and it also seems to be implied in the Tur, as I wrote at the end of section 23. According to this, there is a concern that he might nullify or issue a preemptive declaration of voiding after the writing [of the get]. Therefore, they wrote that he should not be allowed to go out. However, in the Shulchan Aruch, which requires two nullifications of the preemptive declaration of voiding, one before the writing and the other before the giving, it does not matter if he goes out after the writing, since he will nullify the preemptive declaration again before the giving. But this is also reasonable because this nullification is only effective according to those who hold that the get itself cannot be nullified. But for those who hold that the get itself can be nullified, the nullification of the preemptive declaration does not help, as we explained in section 134, paragraph 19. Therefore, they were also concerned about this opinion.",
                    "Our Sages, the authors of the Shulchan Aruch, wrote in Section 14 that the sage should ask the husband giving the get (divorce bill) whether he is doing so under coercion or if he has sworn to give the get. As we have already written in Section 65, there is more concern if he has sworn not to give the get, and it could be said in such a case that if he acts, it does not take effect. Therefore, it is necessary to additionally ask the husband about this matter. This is also my practice, as we will explain with God's help (and so wrote the Chatam Sofer).",
                    "<b>27</b> Further, it is written in paragraph 15 that the husband should hand over the parchment, other writing instruments, the quill, and the ink to the scribe in the presence of witnesses, and say to him in their presence: \"Write me a get (bill of divorce) for the sake of divorcing my wife, [name] daughter of [name], for the sake of severance, and I give you permission to write the get from one to a hundred times until one is valid without any doubt, whether in writing or in signing, according to the opinion of the scholar, Rabbi [name], or anyone he shows it to.\" And the scribe should respond, \"I will do so.\" However, this only works after the fact (b'diavad). Therefore, the custom is also initially (l'chatchila) that the scribe transfers to him much parchment and ink in case he writes many gets as commanded, which is valid after the fact. But initially, if he wrote an invalid get, the custom is that the scribe transfers everything back to him, and the husband again commands him to write, and annuls any notifications, as he did initially. Refer later to paragraph 54. And when the husband gives the items to the scribe, he should give them himself and not through a messenger, as it is written. Similarly, it is written regarding witnesses when he commands them to sign, as it is written. And he may say it in any language he wishes, as it is written.",

And according to this, it is better to say, \"Write me a get for my name, Ploni son of Ploni, to divorce my wife, Plonit daughter of Ploni, and write it for my name and her name and for the purpose of divorce.\" And this is the simple custom among us, and this is the formula in the order of the get by Rabbi Meir of Krakow, printed at the end of the Shulchan Aruch, letter 52. See there. And the intention of the Shulchan Aruch is also the same, but they wrote it concisely.",
                    "<b>29</b> However, what is written that one should tell him to write from one to one hundred until one is deemed valid according to the opinion of a certain sage, this ruling stems from Rabbeinu Yitzchak the Elder, the Tosafist (Gittin 63b). But one of the early authorities, Rabbeinu Yosef Klatzon, wrote that there is a concern of retroactive clarification (bereira) in this matter. For after a certain get (bill of divorce) is deemed valid according to the rabbi, we would need to say that retroactively it has been clarified that the husband's intention was for this get. And we hold that there is no retroactive clarification in matters of Torah law. This is brought in the Mordechai in the glosses to chapter 6 of Gittin. Similarly, the Gra (Vilna Gaon) wrote in section 122, subsection 2, and added that Rabbeinu Yitzchak the Tosafist follows his own opinion that there is retroactive clarification, as mentioned by the Ran and the Rosh in his name in chapter 5 of Nedarim. But for us, it is not proper to act in this manner. And as we have already explained there, I do not customarily say this. And so, my esteemed colleague, the Gaon Rabbi A.M. Halevi Horowitz, Av Beit Din of Pinsk, told me that he and the Gaon Rabbi Mordechai of blessed memory, who was before him, also did not practice this. And even though there is room to argue and explain that this is not considered retroactive clarification, as we wrote there, nevertheless, why should we enter into a narrow breach concerning a get? Therefore, it is better to simply say that if this get is invalid, we will arrange another get and he will repeat his statement, as we explained there. And so we will arrange it later, with God's help.",
                    "<b>30</b> And this which they wrote that the husband should give them to the scribe by himself and not through an agent, this is ideally better that he gives it by himself. But according to the law, a person's agent is like the person himself. And the Levush wrote the reason is because all these are considered \"words\" (mili) since he does not transfer anything to him and \"words\" cannot be transferred to an agent. And certainly, to say that the scribe should write a get (divorce document), the scribe must hear it from the husband himself. And if he says, \"tell him\" it is invalid. According to the Rambam, there is a concern of invalidation from the Torah because of the concept of \"words\" as we explained in Siman 120. But the delivery of the paper and the writing tools to the scribe to write is not related to \"words\" at all. And similarly, it is clarified from the language of the Shulchan Aruch that they wrote that ideally, he should give them by himself, and it is clarified that this is only for extra meticulousness.",
                    "Not only that, they also wrote that if two gittin (divorce documents) need to be written due to doubt concerning names, such as Gershon or Gershom and the like, the husband who is divorcing should tell the scribe that if Rabbi So-and-So wishes to arrange several gittin due to doubt so that they can all be given to the woman, he grants him permission to write them. He should also inform the witnesses that he grants them permission to sign them. And it has already been clarified in Siman 129 that two gittin are only given out of necessity. First, the one that seems more valid according to the law with all the questions is given, and afterward, the second one with all the questions is given. The rabbi should explain to those present why two gittin are being given and should tell the husband to intend to divorce with each of the gittin. If both are given in one order, one after the other, it is valid. This is the opinion of our teacher, the Rema, and we have explained there that the great later authorities were concerned about the issue of clarification (bererah). Therefore, they instituted that the rabbi should not reveal to the husband, the scribe, or the witnesses that two gittin are needed. Instead, he arranges the get (divorce document) that appears more valid to him, and after the giving, the rabbi says that it seems he made a mistake in writing the first get and a second get is needed. Thus, each time the husband gives the get unconditionally, and there is no concern about clarification. This can be done with a get given directly from the husband to the wife, but with a get given through an agent, this cannot be done. Therefore, in the case of a get given through an agent, it is necessary to avoid two gittin as much as possible, and it is better to decide and write the one that seems more valid according to the law.",
                    "The scribe should not write, nor should the witnesses sign, until they hear from the husband himself that he instructed the scribe to write and the witnesses to sign, and not from an agent, even if he told three people to tell a specific person to write and specific people to sign. They should not write or sign until they hear it from his own mouth. This is explained at length in Siman 121. Similarly, the witnesses in whose presence the husband instructed the scribe to write must themselves be instructed to sign, for if he instructs others to sign, they cannot sign since they did not hear when he instructed the scribe to write. How can they sign and testify that the Get (divorce document) was written properly if they do not know if the husband instructed the scribe to write? (This is the intention of the Gra in Se'if 37.) Even if witnesses testify before them that they heard the husband instruct the scribe to write, it is considered hearsay (secondary witness testimony). (See Tosafot Gittin 67a, s.v. \"amru,\" and examine further.)",
                    "<b>33</b> Our master, the Beit Yosef, wrote in section 21 that the witnesses must stand by the scribe during the writing of the line containing the name of the man, the name of the woman, and the date, and they must hear him writing it for his sake and for her sake. They must recognize that this is the get (divorce document) that the scribe wrote for his sake and for her sake. Therefore, if they wish to go outside after the names and date have been written, they must make some sign on the get so they can recognize it, or it should have some distinguishing mark. It is also good for the husband to be present with the scribe and the witnesses until the get is written, signed, and delivered, so that he does not make a declaration (moda'ah) against it, and also so that no matters concerning the get are discussed until after it is given, to avoid any statements that could lead to the invalidation of the get. And in section 76 he wrote that if the husband goes out between the writing and the delivery, the sage who arranges the get should make him swear that he has not nullified the get in any way, has not made any declaration, and has not said anything that would cause the get to be invalidated.",
                    "34. Now, regarding what is mentioned that the witnesses should stand during the writing of the names of the man and the woman and the date, in Siman 131, se'if 8, it is written explicitly that they only need to stand at the beginning. Indeed, even for a messenger, the Sages did not require more than this. Moreover, even if he only hears the sound of the quill as it writes for its specific purpose, it is sufficient. In truth, some say that only the messenger needs to stand, but the witnesses do not need to stand at all during the beginning of the writing (Beit Shmuel there, se'if katan 9). In the order of the get (divorce document) of the Mordechai, it is explicitly written so, and we have brought his words there in se'if 12. We have explained there that his words are not contradictory; rather, in the order of the get, he was concerned with additional stringencies. Our custom is simple: the witnesses stand during the first line, which according to our version, contains only the date. However, they also stand while the scribe scores the lines, during which he states that he is scoring for his sake, for her sake, and for the sake of the divorce. Thus, even according to the stringency mentioned here, this suffices.",
                    "When the scribe comes to write the get (divorce document), before he begins writing, he must ask the husband his name and his father's name, and whether he or his father have any secondary names due to illness, or any nicknames or titles, and whether they are Kohanim or Levites. Similarly, he should ask the same questions to the wife and her father, just as with the man. The laws of names are explained in Siman 129. However, among us, we do not rely on the scribe for this; the rabbi who arranges the get first investigates and inquires about the names, and he instructs the scribe how to write them. Therefore, what is mentioned in the Shulchan Aruch, Siman 37, that the scribe should ask these questions in front of the witnesses, is because when the rabbi does this, there is no need for witnesses. This is self-evident.",

Also, what is written there that some say that before the scribe cuts the parchment, he should speak before the witnesses that he intends to write it for the sake of the specific person, and so is the custom in these countries. The simple custom among us is that before he begins to line the parchment, the scribe says: \"Listen to me, you witnesses, so-and-so and so-and-so. All the corrections that I make for the sake of the get, I am doing them for the sake of the husband, so-and-so, to divorce his wife, so-and-so.

According to several authorities, even when detached, it is considered a deficiency of cutting, as stated in Section 124. Even if he has not completed the entire get and has only begun to write it, he is prohibited from cutting anything from it. Therefore, if he began to write and a disqualification occurred, and he wishes to write another get on that same parchment or paper, he should not begin to write and then cut off the small portion he wrote; rather, he should cut it first and then begin to write.",

And although we have deliberated this extensively in Siman 120, Se'if 65 (see there), nonetheless, Heaven forbid to go against their words. It is clear that for a scribe whom the husband did not instruct to write, it is invalid by Torah law if he writes it. Therefore, it is forbidden to make any corrections in the get except by the scribe whom the husband instructed. And if that scribe is unavailable, the husband must instruct another scribe to make the correction, because for minor corrections, even according to those who invalidate a get by two scribes, there is no concern regarding the correction.",
                    "Section 39: The parchment or paper must be longer in length than in width, and its length is defined by the way it is read from beginning to end. One should leave a margin at the bottom sufficient to hold by hand or more, but if not done, it is not critical after the fact. The requirement that its length be greater than its width applies to the paper itself, even if the written area alone is wider, it is not a concern. There is an opinion that the written area itself must also be longer than its width. However, as we have explained in Siman 125, section 53, one should not be meticulous about this even initially, because if we are meticulous about this, the writing will not be proper. This is also the opinion of Rabbi Moshe Isserles (Rema), and this is the ruling of the sage Rabbi Moshe ben Chaviv in his book \"Get Pashut.\"",
                    "One should draw thirteen lines, that is, twelve complete lines and one line divided into two parts where the witnesses will sign one below the other. One should not draw lines with a lead-based substance so that it does not resemble writing on top of writing. Nor should one draw lines on the inside where the writing is, to avoid interruptions in the letters. Instead, the lines should be drawn on the outside. Additionally, two lines should be drawn on the sides of the get (divorce document), one on the right and one on the left, to align the writing. Care should be taken that the writing is beside the lines and not on the lines themselves. Even though the entire get is written on the lines themselves, nevertheless, with the side lines, one should be careful so that the writing is aligned. This is not invalid if one is not careful in this regard. When writing on parchment, it is said that one should write on the flesh side and not on the hair side. However, after the fact, it is not a strict requirement. Some say that one should not write with a quill made of a feather but rather with a reed. We write with a feather quill as explained there. One should ensure that the writing is not crooked or confused, lest one letter resemble another and the meaning change. It is known that when writing with a reed, the writing does not come out straight, and therefore we write with a feather quill. It is only forbidden to write with a metal quill to avoid engraved writing, as explained there.",
                    "<b>40</b> The custom is to be stringent and make the letters surrounded by parchment. If there are letters that are stuck together, one can scrape off the ink between them to separate them, and this is not considered carving out the insides since it is not part of the letter itself. However, some prohibit this, and only in pressing circumstances should one scrape, as I wrote in Siman 125, see there. One must be very careful that the letters do not intrude into each other, as this would change the shape of the letter. For example, the head of a Lamed in the lower line should not intrude into the space of the Hei or the Chet in the upper line, and similarly for all other cases. If the shape of the letter is changed, it is completely invalid, as mentioned there. The letters should not extend beyond the lines to the right or left into the margin, and one should be stringent even for a single letter, as it appears as if it is not part of the main text of the Get (Jewish bill of divorce), as explained there, see there.",

Regarding the name (of God), there are many detailed laws on this, see there. The writing should not have any blurring, and one should not write on an erasure. This is not an absolute disqualification, as this disqualification is because writing on something that can be forged is not allowed, and when it is on authenticated document paper, it is valid. We have explained several laws regarding this matter there. However, removing the ink from within the letter when the letter is not recognizable is a complete disqualification. Similarly, if one intended to make an open \"mem\" but his hand slipped and it became closed, one cannot scrape away the adhesion to open it, as this would be considered carving out the interior, which is a complete disqualification. Even in the draft of the bill of divorce (get), one must be careful to write it correctly, although there is not as much stringency as in the essential part regarding erasure, as written there. When a bill of divorce (get) is disqualified, another must be written. It has also been clarified that a new arrangement must be made and the husband must command anew for the scribe to write and the witnesses to sign.",

However, we do not know of any strict requirement in this matter at all, and there is no hint of this in the early or later authorities. Generally, this is how it happens naturally. However, if there are many names with nicknames, one should not force the writing because of this, as there is no strict requirement.

The get must be given on the same day it is written; otherwise, it is considered predated, and it cannot be corrected unless it is sent through an agent, in which case a predated get is valid, as stated in Siman 128. Any get sent to another place cannot be given on the same day. Care should be taken that the husband does not seclude himself with her between the writing and the giving of the get, and similarly, at the time of writing, he should not seclude himself with her so that it will not be an \"old get,\" and an \"old get\" should not be used for divorce, as stated in Siman 149 (see there).",
                    "It is well-known that a minor girl and a young girl are under the authority of their father as long as they have not matured or married. Therefore, if a young girl who is divorced is a minor, whether betrothed or married, she can be divorced by receiving the get herself. If the father receives the get and she is betrothed, since she has not yet matured, she is considered divorced. However, if she has matured or married, even if she is still a young girl, she cannot be divorced by her father's acceptance. Similarly, if she is a minor and married, she cannot be divorced by her father's acceptance. There are those who dispute this and adopt a stringent approach (Tosafot Kiddushin 10a, “And he receives,” who explicitly state that the father cannot receive it; similarly Rashi, the Rashba, and the Ran in Ketubot 46b). If she is a minor betrothed through her father, it is clear that she can be divorced, and through herself, there is a dispute, and it is appropriate to be stringent that she should only receive it through her father (see Kiddushin 44b and Tosafot there). The matter of a minor being divorced is specifically when she can discern between her get and something else, meaning when given a pebble she throws it away, and when given a nut she takes it, or when she has reached the age of discernment, which is around six or seven years old, each according to her intellect. But if she is below this age, she cannot be divorced according to Rashi, even through her father. According to Rabbeinu Tam, specifically through herself, but through her father, she can be divorced, and the Rosh agreed with this (this is explained in Tosafot Gittin 64b, “And all,” and in the Rosh there). Rabbeinu Beit Yosef wrote in section 96 that if a minor is divorced through her father, it is proper to write two gittin, one in the usual format and the second stating “your daughter so-and-so who was my wife, etc.” His words end there. And in section 141 it is explained that one can deliver the get to the minor with the father's consent, see there. Therefore, in such a case, only one get is needed. There is no need to elaborate further since in our times the custom is not to marry off minors at all. The measure of a minor, a young girl, and a mature girl will be clarified in section 155, with God's help.",

In this way, the get will be given. If the husband does not agree to this condition, the get will not be arranged for him.

Additionally, he instructs everyone that when responding to questions requiring a 'yes' or 'no' answer, they should not say 'yes' twice or 'no' twice, but rather answer once. This is written by our teacher, the Rema, in section 73, and similarly in the order of Rabbi Moses of Kraków, section 34. The reason is that saying 'yes' or 'no' twice is akin to an oath, which is unnecessary (Levush). As stated in Yoreh De'ah, section 237, this is only a stringency. The idea that twice is like an oath applies only when one intends for an oath, as the Rosh wrote in chapter 4 of Shevuot. Otherwise, it is merely an emphasis. Yet, it is proper to be cautious from the outset since this directive comes from our teacher, the Rema, of blessed memory. The rabbi also instructs the woman to cover her face with a veil until the time of delivery, or she should distance herself until the time of delivery by sitting in another room or in the same room but at a distance, because it is not proper etiquette for her to stand with her face uncovered before everyone for the entire time.",

Or perhaps the opposite, that you have accepted upon yourself a prohibition or vow or oath or handshake or acceptance of a contract not to divorce her; tell us, and we will annul it for you.\" The husband replies, \"I have not made any vow, nor sworn, nor imposed a prohibition, nor handshake, nor acceptance of a contract, neither to divorce her nor not to divorce her.\" The rabbi then asks him again, \"Perhaps you swore or vowed or imposed a prohibition or handshake or acceptance of a contract to divorce or not to divorce, and you forgot, and later you will remember and contest the get. Therefore, we will annul them for you.\" The husband replies, \"Perhaps I did vow or swear or handshake or accept a contract on either of the two conditions, to divorce or not to divorce; I ask of you to annul them for me, and I regret them from the outset.\" The rabbi and the judges then say three times, \"It is permitted to you, it is permitted to you, it is permitted to you,\" as is the law of annulling vows that requires three people and to say three times, \"It is permitted to you.\" If indeed he accepted a contract on the get as per the usual custom, where initially they accept a contract, they annul the contract for him and say, \"This contract is null and void,\" and he also agrees to it with the consent of the wife. He then repeats, \"I am giving this get of my own free will, without any compulsion or coercion whatsoever.\" All of this is said in the common vernacular of that country.",

This means he may give collateral for the giving of the get (bill of divorce), and if he does not give it, the collateral will be lost to him, and it will be given to her or to another as he agreed upon. This is not considered coercion for the get itself, but for another matter, as explained in Siman 134 and in this Siman, section 65. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to distance oneself even from this, and in our times, we have not heard of such a practice.",

I hereby annul before you all preconditions and preconditions of preconditions, and any declarations that stem from preconditions of preconditions, up to the end of all preconditions that I have made regarding this get.

The reason is that as long as it is wet, it is considered writing that can be forged. However, when there is a pressing need, there is no strictness about this. There is another reason that it is considered writing that is not permanent, and the concern is only at the time of giving the get. We have already explained at the end of section 130 that many of the great authorities have disputed this stringency. Therefore, if time is short, such as being close to evening or similar situations, there is no need to be strict about this at all, and the witnesses should sign immediately after the writing, and it can be dried after the signatures.",

If he finds anything that needs minor correction, he instructs the husband to command the scribe to make the corrections, as no corrections should be made without the husband's instruction. He also examines the signatures to ensure that the words and letters were signed as required. If any signature requires correction, he tells the husband to instruct the witness to correct it, as stated. Additionally, he checks if the witnesses' signatures are not more than two lines away from the written text, as this would invalidate the get if they are. He also ensures that the witnesses' signatures start at the beginning of the line, without leaving a blank space before their signatures on the right side of the paper opposite the text, and that their signatures align with the text of the get.

Be aware that what our master, the Beit Yosef, wrote in Section 76—that if the husband leaves his presence between the writing and the giving, the rabbi should make him swear that he did not annul the get—is not our custom. For, in any case, if he is suspected of this, he is properly guarded. And if, Heaven forbid, there is a reason and evidence that he annulled it, we do not rely on his oath and we tear up this get and write another one.

Some are stringent and say to ask her if she has made a vow or taken an oath, but we do not follow this practice because there is no impediment if she has made a vow or taken an oath. Additionally, the reason we ask her if she accepts it willingly is only to fulfill the decree of Rabbeinu Gershom. If her face is covered, it should be uncovered, for the witnesses need to see her when she receives the get from the husband. The rabbi informs her that immediately upon receiving the get from her husband, she is separated from him and will be permitted to marry anyone she wishes, except for a Kohen (priest).

Know that if a reason arises that, after the writing of the get, it is invalidated, he should not tear it crosswise and lengthwise due to the potential stumbling block, as it might later be found torn in the manner of a get given post-divorce, and people might say she was already divorced with it. Instead, he should burn it or store it whole, though it is better to burn it or tear it into small pieces. After the get is completed, the rabbi blesses them for success, and they depart from him.",

And if I come within the mentioned time and appear before so-and-so, it will not be a get, and she is believed to say that I did not come and that I did not appease her.\" And if the one divorcing is a dangerously ill person (shekhiv me'ra), he says to her at the time of giving: \"This is your get and you are hereby divorced from me from now and permitted to any man, on the condition that if I do not die by a certain day, and that day included, it will not be a get.

This is because it is explained in Choshen Mishpat, Siman 39, that any document made without the instruction of the interested party does not have the status of a document. It is not clarified in the authorization document that the principal instructed the witnesses to write the authorization. Therefore, he acted in the case of a power of attorney for a Get (divorce document) in my place and added to the authorization that the principal instructed them to write the authorization. I responded to him that our predecessors did well not to mention this because the rule that a document made without the instruction of the interested party is not a document applies specifically to a document that involves some obligation to another in its writing. By law, it is not possible to do this, such as a borrower who borrows from a lender orally; it is forbidden for them to create a document, as this would change from an oral loan to a written loan, and he would not be believed to say he repaid, and it would be collectible from purchasers, as explained by the Rashbam in Bava Batra 40, s.v. \"Hoda'ah,\" and Tosafot there, s.v. \"Mach'ah.\" Therefore, Tosafot there and in Ketubot 20, labored to explain.",

For the husband, it is not an obligation since it is his will, and on the contrary, it is to his benefit, as through this, the divorce document will reach her as per his will, since he is divorcing willingly. Therefore, the husband's consent and command are not needed here (see what is written in Aruch HaShulchan there, section 18).",

This serves as the validation, and the validation of documents requires three people. According to the fundamental law, the messenger can be counted among the three, as a messenger can serve as a witness, and a witness can serve as a judge in rabbinic law. This validation is of rabbinic origin (Gittin 5b). However, if the witness is unfit to serve as a judge, such as a woman or a relative, then three people are needed excluding the unfit witness. Therefore, we are stringent in all cases to ensure that there are three people. Additionally, we are stringent that besides the three who constitute the Beit Din, there should be another two as witnesses to the delivery. This is explained at length in Siman 142, see there.",

Afterwards, the get should be given to him in the form of an agency for delivery.

Therefore, the great sages of the previous generation permitted this. Additionally, we explained there in paragraph 63 that there was someone who wanted to institute that the husband should appoint an emissary here like all other emissaries, and that emissary should appoint another emissary in the place where the wife is, without the husband's presence.

Therefore, this second agent appointed before us, the court, so-and-so as an agent, and before us delivered the get to him to bring to the aforementioned woman. And thus, so-and-so said before us to so-and-so, 'Take this get to so-and-so, the wife of so-and-so, and place it in her hand wherever you find her. Your hand shall be as my hand, and your mouth as my mouth, and you have the authority to appoint an agent and that agent to appoint another agent, even up to ninety-eight agents, even without coercion. As soon as this get reaches her hand from your hand or from the hand of your agent, she will be divorced from her husband, so-and-so, and permitted to marry any man.' The get, for which so-and-so was appointed as an agent to deliver, was written and signed in such-and-such a city, on such-and-such a day (as stated in the get), and its witnesses signed on it, so-and-so and so-and-so. What we saw and did before us, we have written and signed, and everything is firm and valid.\" Signed by: so-and-so, judge; so-and-so, judge; so-and-so, judge.",
                    "11. The giving to the hand of the third agent and the giving from the hand of the third agent to the woman is all as explained with the second agent, of course. And similarly, the third when making a fourth, and so on and so forth, up to one hundred.",
                    "12. It has already been explained in Siman 141 that when both the man and the woman are in the same city, it is preferable not to have the get (divorce document) delivered by an agent for delivery, so that the husband cannot claim that he gave it to the agent as a deposit and not for divorce. Therefore, when there is authorization, it is permitted even when both are in the same city, since the husband cannot claim that he gave it as a deposit, as the authorization proves that it was given for divorce.",
                    "13. If both the husband and wife are present, but the husband is in a hurry to leave and cannot wait until the get (divorce document) is written, he is also permitted to proceed. After he expresses that he is giving the get willingly and nullifies any prior declarations, he takes the paper, ink, quill, and writing instruments from the scribe, who has given them to him as a gift. He says in the presence of witnesses, \"You, so-and-so, write for me a get for my wife, so-and-so, and write it for my name, her name, and for my purpose of divorce. And you, witnesses so-and-so and so-and-so, sign this get.\" This is similar to what was stated earlier regarding the scribe.\n\nAdditionally, there should be another person appointed as an agent, and the husband should say to him, \"I hereby appoint you, so-and-so, as my agent to deliver this get to my wife, so-and-so. Give it to her wherever you find her. I grant you permission to appoint another agent and that agent to appoint another agent, etc., according to the authorization format.\" Therefore, two more witnesses are needed for the authorization, as per the law of a get delivered by an agent.\n\nIt is understood that in such a get, we do not write \"the husband standing in such a place\" because he is leaving, nor do we write \"the wife standing in such a place,\" as he grants the agent permission to give it to her wherever she may be found. Perhaps she will leave before the get is written. They are not required to write the get immediately; they can write it the next day or whenever they choose, and they should write the date of the actual writing, not the date of the verbal instruction. See Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer, Section 149:30 (and in Pischei Teshuvah, Subsection 19).\n\nIt has already been explained that he can appoint an agent even not in his presence by saying, \"I hereby appoint so-and-so as an agent to deliver a get to my wife, so-and-so,\" etc. It has also been explained that if it is necessary to mention any condition, it should not be mentioned, Heaven forbid, neither at the time of writing nor to the agent. Rather, he should request from the agent beforehand that when he needs to deliver the get, he should receive such-and-such from her and explicitly state that he is not imposing a condition and is explicitly saying that he is giving the get unconditionally. He is merely expressing his desire, and presumably, the agent will try to fulfill his desire. Refer to what was mentioned earlier in Section 147. It is advisable to avoid even this. With this, all the procedures for the get are completed with the help of Heaven.",
                    "The passage provided, \"סליק,\" translates to \"Completed\" or \"Concluded.\""
